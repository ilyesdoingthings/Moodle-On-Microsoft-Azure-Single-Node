## Provisioning a Scalable Moodle Cluster on Azure 

If you have Azure account, you can deploy Moodle via the Azure portal, or you can deploy Moodle via the CLI. 
Please note that while you can use an Azure free account to get started depending on which template configuration you choose you will likely be required to upgrade to a paid account.

Below is a list of pre-defined deployment options based on typical deployment scenarios (i.e. dev/test, production etc.). All configurations are fixed, and you just need to pass your ssh public key to the template for logging in to the deployed VMs. For production deployments, large size or Maximum template below is highly recommended which provisions high performance SKUs and configures the environment for high availability.

```
cd /opt
sudo git clone git://git.moodle.org/moodle.git
cd moodle
```

2. Determine the latest stable Moodle release from Moodle‚Äôs official list of releases. At the time of writing, the latest stable release is 4.0.

5. Copy the directory with the Moodle repository into the /var/www/html directory. Then, modify the new Moodle directory‚Äôs permissions to grant read, execute, and write access to any user.

```
sudo cp -R /opt/moodle /var/www/html/
 sudo chmod -R 0777 /var/www/html/moodle
```

6. Create a /var/moodledata directory, make www-data its owner, and modify its permissions to grant all users read, execute, and write access.

```
sudo mkdir /var/moodledata
sudo chown -R www-data /var/moodledata
sudo chmod -R 0777 /var/moodledata
 ```
 
 ## Set Up the MySQL Server for Moodle Instance 
 
 1. Open the MySQL interface as the root user.
 
 ```
 sudo mysql -u root
 ```
2. Use the following MySQL command to create a database for Moodle.

```
CREATE DATABASE moodle DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

3. Create a Moodle MySQL user, and give it the required permissions on the Moodle database. In the following example, replace moodle-user and password with the username and password, respectively, you would like to use for the Moodle MySQL user.

```
CREATE USER 'moodle-user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES,DROP,INDEX,ALTER ON moodle.* TO 'moodle-user'@'localhost';
```

4. Exit the MySQL interface using the quit command.
